# AgroSense - Smart farming and Crop Management using IoT, ML and DB Integration
Aims to empower farmers through an integrated system that combines Arduino-based soil sensors, a Firebase database, a Kotlin/Flutter mobile application, a web platform, and a machine learning model hosted on Gradio.

Farmers face challenges in monitoring and optimizing soil conditions for crop cultivation. Lack of real-time data on soil temperature, humidity, pressure, moisture, and pH levels hinders informed decision-making, leading to suboptimal crop yields.

## We've solved that issue!
